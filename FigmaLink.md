## Notes

I have made changes in the landing page, this includes :
	-Changed the color of the Hero section 
	-Added hover effects to the Nav-items with smooth transition
	-Also added some smooth transition to the items in the Hero Section

This is an example I tried if you are interested and want me to do some more interesting changes please let me know.
This is my first time so I have just tried to do something.
I can add more effects and any other additional thing that you require.
