The current AceHub.ai landing page needs a design overhaul to enhance its structure, layout, and visual appeal while maintaining UX best practices. The focus will be on improving consistency in typography, color usage, and user flow. Additionally, the redesign must incorporate mobile responsiveness, a style guide, accessibility enhancements, and micro-interactions to elevate user engagement. The goal is to create a visually appealing, user-friendly, and high-converting landing page that effectively communicates AceHub.aiâ€™s mission and offerings.
