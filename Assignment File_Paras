I appreciate the opportunity to work on this task. While preparing my submission, I mistakenly redesigned neugence.ai instead of acehub.ai. I realized this just as I was about to submit my work.

However, since both websites are owned by neugence, I focused on maintaining brand consistency and applied design principles that could also be useful for acehub.ai. Iâ€™d love to quickly iterate and tailor my design to match the correct website if needed.

Would you prefer that I submit the current work for review, or should I refine it to align exactly with the correct website before submission? Iâ€™m happy to make adjustments to ensure it meets your expectations.

Looking forward to your guidance!
