I appreciate the opportunity to work on this task. While preparing my submission, I mistakenly redesigned neugence.ai instead of acehub.ai. I realized this just as I was about to submit my work.

However, since both websites are owned by neugence, I focused on maintaining brand consistency and applied design principles that could also be useful for acehub.ai. Iâ€™d love to quickly iterate and tailor my design to match the correct website if needed.

Would you prefer that I submit the current work for review, or should I refine it to align exactly with the correct website before submission? Iâ€™m happy to make adjustments to ensure it meets your expectations.

Looking forward to your guidance!

Still working on the breakpoints of the mobile version of the design. Everything will be completed Soon!
